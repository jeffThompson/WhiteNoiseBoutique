[X] Musicians for events?
	"I'm an artist based in the NYC area, opening a pop-up shop in Brighton this fall dedicated to selling boutique white noise as part of the Brighton Digital Festival. I'd like to have 1-2 live performances by experimental/noise musicians who use white noise or randomness in their practice to perform at the opening reception on Friday, 11 September. My project budget is unfortunately somewhat limited, but I will happily pay travel and libations, plus a great crowd. If interested (or if you know someone who might be a good fit), please email me at mail@jeffreythompson.org with a URL or samples."
